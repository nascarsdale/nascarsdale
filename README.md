This is the page for Nicholas Scarsdale! I am a graduate student in Astrophysics at UCSC, currently finishing my second year.
I work on exoplanets, and right now I am working with the TESS-Keck Survey on identifying atmospheric targets for Webb. 
My long-term interests are focused on the origins of life and planetary habitability. 
I am particularly interested in how perturbing the planetary environment away from the Earth (e.g. host star properties, planet size, planet
irradiation, other planets in the system, etc.) affects life's ability to survive and thrive. 
Before graduate school, I studied the giant clam genus Tridacna and its symbiosis with photosynthetic algae. I was fortunate enough to be
exposed to origins research during a summer internship in a lab studying UV photochemistry's role in shaping 

This page has various code snippets I have written, including some for my favorite old-school real-time strategy game, Age of Empires II.
