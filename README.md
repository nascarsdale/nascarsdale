This is the page for Nicholas Scarsdale! I am a graduate student in Astrophysics at UCSC, currently finishing my second year.
I work on exoplanets, and right now I am working with the TESS-Keck Survey on identifying atmospheric targets for Webb. 
My long-term interests are focused on the origins of life and planetary habitability. 
Before graduate school, I studied the giant clam genus Tridacna and its symbiosis with photosynthetic algae. 

This page has various code snippets I have written, including some for my favorite old real-time strategy game, Age of Empires II.
